# GeoCoding
Using the GeoCoder Plug-in for Python to add a latitude and longitude column a CSV file.
The original CSV does not have the column and the new CSV file is added to it.
Trying to simplify the code. Open to suggestions!
Need to look at which service is being used to Geocode. Currently uses the ArcGIS service. Google service tends to be more accruate.
